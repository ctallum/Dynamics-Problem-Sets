# Dynamics-Problem-Sets
This is a collection problem sets from my 2021 Spring Dynamics Class.

### Problem Set 1

#### 1. Golf Ball Simulation (Air Resistance)

##### Setup
For this problem, a golf ball, with diameter D and mass m, is launched from point p with an initial velocity vector V<sub>0</sub>=v<sub>x<sub>0</sub></sub>**i** + v<sub>y<sub>0</sub></sub>**j** + v<sub>z<sub>0</sub></sub>**k**. The wind is blowing with air velocity V<sub>w</sub>=W<sub>x</sub>**i**+W<sub>y</sub>**j**+W<sub>z</sub>**k** resulting in a drag force, F<sub>D</sub>, acting on te ball. The drag force acts in the direction opposite its velocity and it proportional to the square of the velocity.

#### 2. Two Mass Hopper Simulation

##### Setup
For this problem, two masses, m<sub>upper</sub> and m<sub>lower</sub>, are connected by a linear spring with an unstreched length, L<sub>0</sub>, and a spring constant, K. The upper mass is given an initial downward displacement and is then released, resulting in the hopper jumping.

### Problem Set 2

#### 1. Marble in a Bowl Simulation

##### Setup
A small marble is released at the rim of a hemispherical bowl of radius R = 200 mm with an initial velocity of 100 mm/s in the circumferential direction. The marble slides on the inside surface of the bowl without friction. Gravity acts in the downward vertical direction.

#### Results


#### 2. Roller Coaster Simulation

##### Setup
A rollercoaster has a track that is defined by the function, y=h(1-Bx/L)cos<sup>2</sup>$\pi$



### Problem Set 3

#### 1. Planar Pendulum

#### 2. 3D Spring Pendulum

### Problem Set 4

#### Double Pendulum

### Final Project
